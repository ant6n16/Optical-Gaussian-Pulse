# Optical-Gaussian-Pulse

This repository contains the archives created for a project of the subject of Optical Communication of the master in Telecommunications Engineering.
The purpose of this project is to study the propagation of a Gaussian pulse through a dispersive medium such as optical fiber. Attenuation and dispersion phenomena will be analyzed from three formalisms: intermediate frequency, equivalent low pass and full spectrum. In the pdf you can find the explanations of all the details. In turn you can find the MATLAB files to test the three formalisms. Finally, we present a case of communication of a train of pulses that imitates a binary communication (1 when a pulse is transmitted and 0 otherwise).
